# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Module 15

Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

Before You Start
Create a new GitHub repository, "MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis," and initialize the repository with a README.

After you’ve completed the technical analysis for each deliverable, provide a short summary of the results in the README.md of the analysis. For the final deliverable, you’ll write up a short description of the study design for additional statistical analysis. In the written summaries, we would like you to think critically about your analysis, not demonstrate mastery of automotive manufacturing.

Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG (30 points)
Deliverable 1 Instructions
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using your knowledge of R, you’ll design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file. Then, you’ll write a short interpretation of the multiple linear regression results in the README.md.

Follow the instructions below to complete Deliverable 1.

Technical Analysis
Download the MechaCar_mpg.csv file, and place it in the active directory for your R session.
Create a new RScript in your R source pane, name it MechaCarChallenge.RScript, and save it to your active directory.

Use the library() function to load the dplyr package.
Import and read in the MechaCar_mpg.csv file as a dataframe.
Perform linear regression using the lm() function. In the lm() function, pass in all six variables (i.e., columns), and add the dataframe you created in Step 4 as the data parameter.
Using the summary() function, determine the p-value and the r-squared value for the linear regression model.

Save your MechaCarChallenge.RScript file to your GitHub repository.
Written Summary

! https://github.com/Dybondzy/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/edit/main/README.md
In your README, create a subheading, ## Linear Regression to Predict MPG, and write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Deliverable 1 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)

An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values (10 pt)
There is a summary that addresses all three questions (5 pt)
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis (30 points)
Deliverable 2 Instructions
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots. Using your knowledge of R, you’ll create a summary statistics table to show:

The suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots
The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
Then, in the README.md, you’ll briefly detail and interpret the suspension coil summary statistics.

Follow the instructions below to complete Deliverable 2.

Technical Analysis
Download the Suspension_Coil.csv file, and place it in the active directory for your R session.
In your MechaCarChallenge.RScript, import and read in the Suspension_Coil.csv file as a table.
Write an RScript that creates a total_summary dataframe using the summarize() function to get the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI column.
! https://github.com/Dybondzy/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCarChallenge.r

The total summary dataframe showing the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation

Write an RScript that creates a lot_summary dataframe using the group_by() and the summarize() functions to group each manufacturing lot by the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI column.

Your lot_summary dataframe should look like this:

The lot summary dataframe showing the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each manufacturing lot
